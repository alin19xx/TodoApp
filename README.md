# Todo List App with Combine and SwiftUI

## Architecture and Design

The Todo List app uses a **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture design combined with the **Observer pattern**, implemented through the use of **Combine** and **SwiftUI**. This architecture allows for a clear separation of responsibilities and facilitates reactive communication between the user interface and the underlying application state.

### Key Components

- **Model (`Todo`)**: Represents the data structure for a task. Implements `FBModelType` for encoding and identification, and integrates with Firebase Firestore.
- **ViewModel (`CombineTodoListViewModel`)**: Manages the task list state and business logic. Communicates with the data service to perform CRUD operations and publishes updates to the view using `@Published`.
- **View (`TodoListView`)**: User interface built with SwiftUI. Observes changes in the ViewModel through `@StateObject` and updates the UI reactively.
- **DataService (`CombineFirebaseDataService`)**: An abstraction layer for data operations with Firestore. Implements `CombineDataService` to handle asynchronous operations and returns results through `AnyPublisher`.

### Benefits of This Architecture

- **Decoupling**: Separates business logic and UI state, facilitating maintenance and scalability.
- **Reactivity**: The combination of Combine and SwiftUI provides an efficient way to update the UI in response to state changes.
- **Testability**: The clear separation of responsibilities and the use of protocols facilitates unit testing.
- **Integration with Firestore**: The app benefits from Firebase Firestore's real-time data synchronization capabilities.
